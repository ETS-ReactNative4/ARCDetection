## ARCDetection

A simple, modular and cost effective solution for real time mapping of adverse road conditions on a maps based User Interface which has navigational capabilities. 
The solution consists of a mobile application and a physical gadget that can be connected to any Bluetooth enabled device through the provided app. 
Adverse road conditions are detected using Arduino-Uno, accelerometer and gyro sensors, HC05 module.

**Built on:**
  - React Native
  - Firebase
